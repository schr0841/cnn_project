# Overview and Purpose

In this document, we train a convolutional neural network from scratch, and then investigate the added benefit of using pre-trained cnn models on the same dataset. Furthermore, we investigate model ensembling in general and its potential benefits and drawbacks. Here is a brief overview of the structure of Convolutional Neural Networks:


1. Input Layer: The process starts with an image input, which is typically represented as a matrix of pixel values. For a color image, this matrix would have three channels (Red, Green, Blue).

2. Convolutional Layers: These layers apply convolutional filters (or kernels) to the input image. Each filter scans through the image and performs a convolution operation, which involves element-wise multiplication and summing up the results. This process extracts features like edges, textures, and patterns. The result is a feature map that highlights the presence of specific features in different parts of the image.

3. Activation Function: After convolution, an activation function (often ReLU, or Rectified Linear Unit) is applied to introduce non-linearity into the model. This helps the network learn more complex patterns.

4. Pooling Layers: Pooling (often max pooling) is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. It involves taking the maximum or average value from a subset of the feature map, which reduces the number of parameters and computations, and helps the network become more robust to variations in the image.

5. Flattening: The output from the convolutional and pooling layers is a multi-dimensional tensor. This tensor is flattened into a one-dimensional vector to feed into fully connected layers.

6. Fully Connected Layers: These layers are similar to traditional neural networks where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. They combine the features learned by the convolutional and pooling layers to make a final prediction.

7. Output Layer: The final layer is a softmax (or sigmoid) function that outputs probabilities for each class, indicating the network's prediction for the image category.

In summary, CNNs use convolutional and pooling layers to automatically and hierarchically learn features from images, followed by fully connected layers to classify those features into predefined categories. This process enables CNNs to effectively handle and classify complex visual data.





From the Kaggle notebook (2) we have some code to work with for pre-trained models. We evaluate each model on test loss, test accuracy, validation loss and validation accuracy. Below are two tables, each populated using a different type of loss function:

* Investigate ensemble models
* Ensemble validation set - figure out why only 1 epoch / why validation accuracy so low
* Figure out what .h5 files are doing


## Sparse categorical vs categorical loss functions / sparse vs non-sparse class mode generators

Use the Sparse categorical crossentropy loss function when there are two or more label classes. We expect labels to be provided as integers. If you want to provide labels using one-hot representation, please use CategoricalCrossentropy loss. There should be # classes floating point values per feature for y_pred and a single floating point value per feature for y_true.

**class_mode parameter**: One of "categorical", "binary", "sparse", "input", or None. Default: "categorical". Determines the type of label arrays that are returned: - "categorical" gives 2D output (aka. list of numbers of length N), [0, 0, 1, 0], which is a one-hot encoding (only one number is 1/ "hot") representing the target variable. This is for mutually exclusive labels. A dog cannot be a cat, a human is not a dog. "binary" will be 1D binary labels, "sparse" will be 1D integer labels, - "input" will be images identical to input images (mainly used to work with autoencoders). - If None, no labels are returned (the generator will only yield batches of image data, which is useful to use with model.predict_generator()). Please note that in case of class_mode None, the data still needs to reside in a subdirectory of directory for it to work correctly. 

## Pre-training a model

Pre-training a model in the context of neural networks involves training a model on a large dataset before fine-tuning it on a specific task. Here’s a breakdown of what pre-training means and why it’s beneficial:

1. **Initial Training on a Large Dataset**: Pre-training typically involves training a neural network on a broad, general-purpose dataset. For example, in the case of image classification, a model might be pre-trained on a large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, which contains millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

2. **Learning General Features**: During pre-training, the model learns to identify and extract general features from the data, such as edges, textures, and shapes in images, or basic linguistic patterns in text. These features are broadly useful across different tasks and domains.

3. **Transfer Learning**: After pre-training, the model is adapted to a specific task or dataset in a process known as transfer learning. Here, the model's weights, which have been optimized during pre-training, are used as the starting point for training on a new, often smaller, dataset. The model is fine-tuned to learn the specifics of the new task while leveraging the general features it has already learned.

4. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning involves adjusting the pre-trained model's weights to better fit the new task. This can involve retraining some or all of the network's layers, depending on how similar the new task is to the original one.

Benefits of Pre-Training:

* **Improved Performance**: Pre-training allows the model to leverage knowledge learned from a large and diverse dataset, which can lead to better performance on the new task, especially when the new dataset is small or lacks diversity.

* **Reduced Training Time**: Training a model from scratch can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Pre-training on a large dataset and then fine-tuning can significantly reduce the time required to achieve good performance.

* **Better Generalization**: Pre-trained models often generalize better to new tasks because they start with a solid understanding of basic features and patterns, which can help improve accuracy on the new task.

Pre-training is a powerful technique, especially in scenarios where data is scarce or where training a model from scratch would be impractical due to resource constraints.


## Investigate ensemble models


Ensemble learning uses multiple machine learning models to try to make better predictions on a dataset. An ensemble model works by training different models on a dataset and having each model make predictions individually. The predictions of these models are then combined in the ensemble model to make a final prediction.

Every model has its strengths and weaknesses. Ensemble models can be beneficial by combining individual models to help improve upon the predictive performance of each individual model. 

Ensemble models are a way to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by combining the predictions of multiple models. The main idea is that different models might make different kinds of errors, so combining them can reduce the overall error rate. Here’s a breakdown of how ensemble models work and some common techniques:

### How Ensembles Work

1. **Training Multiple Models**: First, you train multiple base models (often called “learners”) on the same problem. These models could be of the same type (e.g., multiple decision trees) or different types (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks).

2. **Combining Predictions**: Once trained, the ensemble combines the predictions of the base models to make a final prediction. The combination can be done in various ways, such as averaging the predictions or using a majority vote.

3. **Reducing Overfitting**: By combining models, ensembles can reduce the risk of overfitting to the training data, as errors made by individual models might be corrected by others in the ensemble.

### Common Techniques

1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**:
   - **Process**: Multiple versions of a model are trained on different subsets of the training data, typically created by sampling with replacement (bootstrap samples). 
   - **Example**: Random Forests, which are ensembles of decision trees.
   - **How it Helps**: Reduces variance by averaging predictions or using majority voting, leading to more stable predictions.

2. **Boosting**:
   - **Process**: Models are trained sequentially. Each new model tries to correct the errors made by the previous models. Weights are adjusted to pay more attention to the misclassified examples.
   - **Example**: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), XGBoost.
   - **How it Helps**: Reduces bias and can convert weak learners into strong learners by focusing on errors of previous models.

3. **Stacking (Stacked Generalization)**:
   - **Process**: Different models are trained on the same data, and their predictions are used as inputs to a final model (meta-model) that makes the ultimate prediction.
   - **Example**: Combining logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks as base models, with a meta-model like a logistic regression model that combines their predictions.
   - **How it Helps**: Leverages the strengths of different models and combines their predictions to potentially achieve better performance than any individual model.

4. **Voting**:
   - **Process**: Each model in the ensemble makes a prediction, and the final prediction is made by taking a majority vote (for classification) or averaging (for regression).
   - **Example**: Simple majority vote among different classifiers.
   - **How it Helps**: Simple to implement and can improve robustness by reducing the likelihood of errors from any single model.

### Advantages of Ensemble Models

- **Improved Accuracy**: By combining models, ensembles often achieve better accuracy than individual models.
- **Reduced Overfitting**: Ensembles can mitigate overfitting by smoothing out errors and variances.
- **Robustness**: They are more robust to changes in the input data and can handle noisy data better.

### Disadvantages of Ensemble Models

- **Increased Complexity**: Ensembles can be more complex to implement and interpret compared to individual models.
- **Computational Cost**: Training multiple models can be computationally expensive and require more resources.

Ensemble methods are a powerful tool in machine learning, often used in practice to achieve higher performance and more reliable predictions.In our specific scenario, the ensemble model uses averaging to select the mode, or the most common predicted class, from the three pre-trained models. By doing this, it allows for further generalization accuracy improvements on the unseen validation data. 



## Ensemble validation set - figure out why only 1 epoch / why validation accuracy not showing up

The **test_steps** parameter in the call to model.evaluate is currently evaluating to 1, so that is why there is only 1 epoch. It seems to be related to the data generator function that we are using - when this parameter was manually increased to 10, a warning was obtained that said the input ran out of data.

The validation accuracy was originally not computed, but we added an appropriate line of code and printed these results to the console. We were then able to add the appropriate result to the table. As we expect, the validation accuracy is much higher than the individual accuracy of the three pre-trained models. 




# Conclusions and Results

## Confusion Matrix of Results for Ensemble Model using Categorical cross entropy loss function
![image](https://github.com/schr0841/cnn_group_project/blob/main/cm_categorical.png)

Above we see the confusion matrix of the ensemble model using the categorical cross entropy loss function as well as the accuracy of 88/% on the test set. On the validation set this accuracy increases further to be 97.5%, which is significantly better than each of the constituent pretrained models (84.4%, 75.9%, and 50.6% respectively) or the base CNN model at 29.2%. This is tangible evidence that shows the true benefit of ensembling applied to the unseen validation data. We also showed how using pre-trained models represents a significant boost in model performance over vanilla CNNs.
